================
Theme for gitweb
================

This is an alternative theme for `gitweb`_ (1.7.3.2+). It is *strongly* inspired by GitHub.

Installation
============

The installation of this stylesheet is very easy. 

1. Just copy the CSS-file `gitweb.css` into the gitweb folder. Best practise
   would be to rename the old file, in case you want to switch back.
2. Copy the `img` folder and its contents on same level as the file   
   `gitweb.css`
3. There is no third point ;)
